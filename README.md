Nessie
======

A nesC compiler in Scala. This project is used in the Compiler Design class at Vermont Technical
College. Its primary purpose is thus educational. It is not, nor is it ever likely to become, a
full implementation of the nesC programming language. See the documentation in the doc folder
for more information about setting up and using Nessie.
