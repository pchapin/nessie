  <title>Nessie Vision Statement</title>

  <para>In this section we outline the philosophy and long range goals of Nessie. By doing so we

    to guide the project's development and be the source of its requirements.</para>

      <para>Nessie's primary purpose is to support education in the area of compiler
        construction. It thus should support that purpose by providing good documentation, offer
        a relatively simple design, and illustrate good software engineering principles</para>
