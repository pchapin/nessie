  <title>Nessie Language</title>

  <para>This chapter contains the specification of the Nessie language. Nessie is intended to be
    an educational subset of the nesC Programming language.</para>

  <para>NesC is...</para>

  <para>Nessie is...</para>

  <para>Ideally any Nessie program would compile as a nesC program allowing the normal nesC
    compiler to be used as a tool during the development and testing of Nessie code. In practice
    this ideal might not be followed 100% in the specification below. However, areas where
    Nessie is incompatible with nesC should be minimized and ultimately removed.</para>
